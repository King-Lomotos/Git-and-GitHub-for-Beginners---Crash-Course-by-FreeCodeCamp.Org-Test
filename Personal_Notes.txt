Important Codes for Github for Terminal 

1. cd 
    - to place the working directory of your git project

2. ls
    - shows the files within that folder that you are using to store Github project

    - after making changes to the files within your Github Project (files on the left side), 
    - you can see what has been uploaded (committed) to Github or not 
       -   Labeled in "Untracked Files" mean that a file has been added but not committed.
       -   Labeled in "Modified" mean that a file has been edited but not committed

6. git push origin main
    - pushes or uploads to Github website/profile 
    - origin (a value that stands for the location of our git repositiory (file pathway))
    - main (the branch name you would want to place the files )
    - Keep in mind the "origin" will only work if you made the github repository in Github and not locally. 
        - If done locally, you have to establish connection. Create a new repository with same name in Github Profile
        - Then, follow step 10 with "git remote"
        - Once completed step 10, then proceed with step 6 to push or upload the changes within repository

    - "remote" means that location isn't local (this computer)
    - Link is from the repository ending with .git 

11. git remote -v
    - shows which remote repositories you are connected to with (fetch) and (push)

12. git push -u origin main
    - "-u" means upstream and it memorizes the location of "origin main" so that you can only type git push instead of the whole code
